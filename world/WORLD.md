- **Parents now in the loop:** Mom and Dad informed of everything; standing guard; aware of real danger
- **Maya's intel source:** Her father recognized Fletcher and knows about the Shadow Hand
- **Healing trigger:** Power activates defensively/reflexively when threatened; Ezra does not fully control it yet
