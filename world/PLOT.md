## Character Development Goals

### Julian
- Learn that being a hero isn't about winning, it's about serving
- His speed power comes from his drive - but using it recklessly hurts friends

### Ezra
- Her healing/creation power grows with emotional maturity
- Big emotions are a gift, not a curse - but need to learn control

### Declan
- Even the youngest can make a difference
- His voice/cry activated something - this is significant

### Ollie
- Always protective, sensing danger
- Has been exposed to Covenant energy before (flashback potential)

## Running Themes to Weave In

- Each power has a cost
- Teamwork beats individual strength
- Truth matters even when it's hard
