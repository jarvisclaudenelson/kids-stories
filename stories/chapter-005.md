# Chapter 5: The Hunt Begins

The next morning, they found Ollie growling at the front door before anyone was even out of bed.

Dad went first—quiet, careful, in the way that meant he'd already decided to be calm no matter what. He looked through the window, then opened the door a crack and peered out. Then he closed it again.

"Fletcher's men," he said, low. "Two of them. Standing just beyond the tree line. Not hiding."

"They *want* us to see them," Julian said.

Mom had both hands wrapped around her coffee mug. Ezra could feel what she was feeling—a tightly controlled worry, like a knot someone had been pulling tighter all night. She looked at the boys. "Nobody goes out alone today. Not for anything."

Declan was sitting on the floor putting his shoes on the wrong feet. "Coldie mans," he said conversationally.

Julian crouched beside him and switched the shoes. "Yeah, bud. The cold men are watching the house."

"Okay," Declan said, and held up his hands to be lifted, which Julian did.

Ezra stood at the window and looked at the two figures in the tree line. Even from here, through the glass, he could feel them. Not warm. Not cold exactly, either. Empty was a better word. Like a room nobody had lived in for a long time.

The star in his chest pulsed twice, uneven.

*I know,* Ezra thought back at it.

Maya came to the back door an hour later, Tyler behind her, both of them breathing like they'd run. Maya's eyes were bright and serious.

"My dad called Captain Okonkwo last night," she said, stepping inside before Mom had even fully opened the door. "Told him everything. Fletcher's background, the Shadow Hand, the way he chased you." She looked at Ezra. "Okonkwo's going to question him today. Officially."

"Will that stop him?" Julian asked.

Maya pressed her lips together. "Dad says probably not. Fletcher will have an explanation for everything. He's good at that." She set a folded piece of paper on the counter. "But Dad also found this."

Dad unfolded it. Ezra stepped on his tiptoes to see. It was a hand-drawn map of the colony—the buildings, the tree lines, the Deep Dig. Several spots were circled in red.

"What are the circles?" Mom asked.

"Places where the Shadow Hand has people stationed," Maya said. "We think. Dad recognized three of them from the research station." She tapped the map. "They're not just watching us. They're watching the Deep Dig too. And the crystal spire."

The star pulsed again. Harder.

Julian studied the map, forehead creased. "They think Ezra might go back to the Vault."

"Or that the Vault might do something on its own," Tyler said quietly. He'd been quiet this whole time, Ezra noticed. His worry came through differently than Maya's—not bright and forward-facing but deep and inward, like a stone sinking in still water. Tyler was scared but trying not to show it. Ezra respected that.

"I'm not going back to the Vault," Ezra said.

Everybody looked at him.

"Not yet," he added. "There's something I need to figure out first."

"What?" Julian said.

Ezra looked down at his hands. Normal-looking hands. Five-year-old hands, brown eyes, freckles on the knuckles. But they stretched. They grew. They could do things that shouldn't be possible and he still didn't know exactly *how*.

"How it works," he said. "My power. I keep doing it by accident. Fletcher almost got me because I wasn't ready." He flexed his fingers slowly. "I need to be able to do it on purpose."

Julian was quiet for a moment. Then, very slowly, he started to smile—the wide, competitive one that usually meant he was about to suggest something their parents would disapprove of.

"We need a training spot," he said.

"No," Mom said immediately.

"Not near the colony. Somewhere the Shadow Hand guys aren't watching."

"Julian—"

"I'll go with them," Dad said.

Mom turned to look at him.

"I'm not sending them out there alone," Dad said. "But he's right. If Ezra can't control it, the next time Fletcher tries something, it could go wrong." He looked at Mom steadily, the way they looked at each other when they'd already made a decision but were being polite about it. "I'll take them. Maya, Tyler—ask your dad if he'll come with us. Backup is good."

Mom set down her coffee mug. She picked up Declan and held him against her side. "I'll keep watch here," she said. "You all take Ollie."

They went north.

Away from the colony buildings, away from the tree line where the watchers stood, up through the dense Monscollis forest where the alien pines grew taller than anything on Earth and the ground was soft with copper-colored needles. Ollie ran ahead, zigzagging, nose working constantly.

Maya's dad—a big, quiet man named Marcus who looked like he'd once been a soldier and might still be one in his heart—walked beside Dad and said very little. He carried a small emergency radio on his belt and kept his eyes moving.

They found a clearing where three massive trees had fallen long ago, their trunks now covered in pale blue-green moss. It felt secret. Forgotten. Good.

"Okay," Julian said, turning to Ezra with the manner of someone who had been appointed coach without asking anyone's permission. "Show us what you can do."

Ezra took a breath. He thought about the feeling from yesterday—the warm rush outward, the taffy-pull sensation in his arm. He held out his hand and tried to *reach*. Just reach, farther than his arm should go.

His fingers stretched three inches and stopped.

"More," Julian said.

"I'm trying."

"*More.* Think about something far away. Something you need to reach."

Ezra closed his eyes. He thought about Declan on the floor at the cabin with his shoes on the wrong feet. He thought about the way Declan's little face lit up when you picked him up. He thought about reaching all the way back there, all the way back to—

His arm shot out like a rubber band snapping. It went six feet. Eight. Stopped just short of a tree trunk on the other side of the clearing.

Tyler made a noise that was something between a gasp and a laugh.

Ezra opened his eyes. He was staring at his own arm, which was very far from the rest of him.

"Huh," he said.

"*DO THAT AGAIN*," Julian said, loud enough that Ollie startled.

"Julian, volume," Dad said, but he was grinning.

Ezra tried again. He found that if he pictured something he cared about—not just a thing, but a *person*, a specific face—the power came easier. It was like the warmth in his chest built a bridge between wanting and doing. He stretched both arms at once and felt the satisfying, ridiculous sensation of being very long, like a person-shaped piece of silly putty. When he snapped back, he landed on his feet and felt fine. Not tired. Not scared.

Good.

For the next hour, they worked. Julian started inventing drills in an enthusiastic and completely chaotic way—"Okay, hit that branch! Now grab that rock without moving your feet!"—while Marcus watched from a log and occasionally offered calm practical suggestions that were much more useful. Ezra learned that he could stretch individual body parts independently, that moving while stretched was harder than being still, and that if he tried to stretch *too* far too fast, his arms felt like they'd been asleep and his fingers tingled.

He also learned something else.

It happened when Ollie, who had been investigating something in the undergrowth, suddenly went completely still. All four legs planted. Hackles up. A low, continuous sound from deep in his chest that wasn't quite barking.

Everyone stopped.

Marcus was on his feet first. "Where?"

Ollie was looking northeast. Through the trees.

Ezra felt it before he saw anything—a sharp, ice-pick feeling cutting through the warmth in his chest. Not cold like Fletcher's emptiness. This was something different. This was a signal. The star pulsing fast and urgent, like a fire alarm going off very far away.

"There," Ezra whispered.

Seventy feet away, barely visible through the trees, a figure stood watching them. Not one of Fletcher's gray-uniformed team. This was someone else entirely—someone in dark clothes, still as a shadow, so still they might have been a trick of the light.

Then the figure turned and walked away, unhurried, and vanished between the trees.

Ollie stopped growling.

Nobody spoke for a long moment.

"Was that Shadow Hand?" Tyler asked.

"I don't know," Marcus said. He was very calm, which made it feel more serious, not less.

Ezra pressed his hand against his chest. The star was still pulsing, but slower now. Not warning-fast. More like a question.

*Did you feel that?*

"Someone else knows about the power," Ezra said. "Not Fletcher. Someone different."

Julian had gone very still—which was unusual for him. Julian was usually in motion, always pushing forward. But right now he stood looking at the place where the figure had been, and his expression was careful in a way Ezra recognized.

His brother was thinking.

"Seven," Julian said suddenly.

"What?" Maya said.

"The Covenant. The power." Julian looked at Ezra. "Remember what the Vault showed you? Multiple fragments?"

Ezra nodded slowly.

"What if someone else already has one?" Julian said.

The forest was quiet. The Monscollis pines breathed around them, tall and alien and old. Somewhere far behind them, back in the colony, the crystal spire pulsed its slow heartbeat.

Ollie pressed himself against Ezra's leg, warm and solid and real.

Ezra reached down and scratched behind his ears. And he thought: *We're not the only ones.*

That could mean allies.

That could mean something worse.
