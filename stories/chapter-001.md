# Chapter 1: The Crash

The alarms screamed.

Julian grabbed his seat straps as the USS Mayflower shuddered like a wounded animal. Red lights flashed everywhere. His little brother Declan was crying—the high-pitched wail that meant he was really scared.

"Buckle up!" Mom shouted from across the cargo bay. She wasstrapping Declan into his seat, her hands shaking.

"What's happening?!" Julian yelled.

"Emergency! Everybody brace!"

The ship lurched. Julian's stomach flew into his throat. Around him, fifty other colonists screamed. Mrs. Chen grabbed her twin kids. Mr. Okonkwo held onto his tablet like it was a life raft. Everyone was scared.

Then—CRASH.

---

Julian woke up to silence.

His ears rang. Everything hurt. For a moment, he didn't know where he was—or if he was even alive.

"Julian!"

Mom's voice. He opened his eyes.

The cargo bay was tilted at a crazy angle. Smoke drifted everywhere. Emergency lights glowed red. And there, climbing over a pile of broken crates, was his mom—carrying a crying Declan in one arm and reaching for him with the other.

"I'm okay," Julian said. His voice sounded weird. "I'm okay, Mom."

"Julian!" That was Ezra's voice. He was stuck in his seat, seatbelt still on, looking scared but okay. "Julian, is everyone okay?!"

"We're okay," Mom said, pulling Julian free. "Where's Ollie?"

They found the dog wedged under a supply cabinet, whimpering. As soon as Julian reached for him, Ollie licked his face and tried to wiggle free. Good boy. Always brave.

The next hour was chaos.

Some colonists were hurt—a broken arm here, a cut there. The ship's doctor, Dr. Martinez, was running around doing what she could. The ship's captain, Captain Reyes, was trying to get the emergency beacon working.

"Mayday to any colony in range," she kept saying. "This is Colony Ship Mayflower. We have crashed. Coordinates unknown. We have survivors. Please respond."

No one answered.

The ship's communications were dead. Half the engines were gone. And they were stranded on a planet no one had ever visited before.

"We need to find shelter," Dad said. He was covered in dust and had a cut on his forehead, but he was thinking clearly. "This isn't a safe place to stay. We need to find higher ground, find the colony if there's one here."

"How far is the colony?" Mom asked.

Captain Reyes checked her tablet. "Three days' walk. Maybe. If the terrain isn't too rough."

Three days. With fifty colonists. With kids.

"We'll make it," Dad said. He always said that when things were hard. Julian wanted to believe him.

The next morning, they started walking.

Julian had to admit the planet was beautiful. The planet reminded him of pictures he had seen of old Earth—lush green forests covered the rolling hills, and in the distance, towering mountains rose up like giants, their peaks still dusted with white. And everywhere, tall evergreen trees stretched toward the sky—forests like the Pacific Northwest, like Seattle's. And in the distance, something glinted—a tall spire of crystal rising from the ground, catching the sunlight.

"What is that?" Ezra asked, pointing.

"I don't know, honey," Mom said. "Maybe it's a natural formation."

Ollie whined and pulled on his leash. He kept looking at the crystal spire, his ears flat, his tail between his legs. He didn't like it.

The colonists walked in a big group. Some adults carried the injured on makeshift stretchers. Kids stayed in the middle. Julian tried to help by carrying extra water, even though it was heavy.

They made it halfway through the first day when the radio crackled to life.

"—Mayflower, this is Monscollis Colony, do you copy?"

Captain Reyes grabbed the radio. "This is Captain Reyes of the Mayflower! We have crashed! We have fifty survivors, including children! We're somewhere to the east of your location!"

"Copy that, Mayflower. We're sending a rescue team. Hold your position if you can. We'll find you."

"Hold our position," Captain Reyes said. "Good. Everyone, we need to—"

A scream cut her off.

Julian spun around. At the back of the group, people were pointing at the sky. Something was coming—fast.

"Get down!" someone yelled.

A第二块 rocks hit the ground twenty feet away. Then another. Then a whole barrage of stones, bouncing down the hillside toward them.

"Run!" Dad shouted. "Everyone run!"

They ran. Julian grabbed Ezra's hand and pulled him along. Mom had Declan. Ollie barked and raced ahead. Behind them, rocks crashed into the path they'd been walking—exactly where they'd been standing seconds before.

When the rockslide stopped, they were separated.

Julian, Ezra, and Ollie were on one side of the rubble. Mom, Dad, Declan, and the rest of the group were on the other.

"JULIAN!" Mom screamed. "EZRA!"

"MOM!" Julian screamed back. "WE'RE OKAY!"

The gap was twenty feet wide and filling with dust. They couldn't cross. The others were cut off—and heading the wrong direction.

"Meet us at the crystal!" Dad shouted. "The big spire! We'll find you!"

And then they were gone.

---

Julian and Ezra stood alone on the hillside, Ollie pressed against their legs.

"Don't worry," Julian said, trying to be brave. "We'll find them. We'll find mom and dad and Decker."

Ezra's lip trembled. "What if we can't?"

"We will." Julian took her hand. "Come on. We have to keep moving."

They started walking toward the crystal spire in the distance.

What they didn't know was that deep below that crystal—something ancient had just noticed them.

Something that had been waiting for a very, very long time.
