# Chapter 1: The Crash

The alarms screamed.

Not the gentle chime that meant breakfast was ready, or the steady beep that reminded everyone about ship maintenance. This was the emergency alarm—three short blasts, then three long ones, repeating over and over until it felt like it was inside Julian's head.

Julian grabbed his seat straps as the USS Mayflower shuddered like a wounded animal. Red lights flashed everywhere, bathing everything in an eerie glow that made everyone look like ghosts. His little brother Declan was crying—the high-pitched wail that meant he was really scared, not just fussy.

"Buckle up!" Mom shouted from across the cargo bay. She was strapping Declan into his seat, her hands shaking so badly she could barely click the buckle. "Hold onto something! Hold onto anything!"

"What's happening?!" Julian yelled. The ship lurched again, throwing him sideways against the wall. Pain shot through his shoulder, but he didn't have time to care.

"Emergency! Everybody brace!"

The ship lurched. Julian's stomach flew into his throat. Around him, fifty other colonists screamed—the terrified kind that comes from knowing something is very, very wrong. Mrs. Chen grabbed her twin kids, pulling them close. Mr. Okonkwo held onto his tablet like it was a life raft, even though it probably wasn't going to help. Everyone was scared.

Then—CRASH.

---

Julian woke up to silence.

Not real silence, of course. There were creaks and groans from the damaged ship, the hiss of escaping air, the drip-drip-drip of something liquid. But it was quiet compared to the chaos before.

His ears rang. Everything hurt. For a moment, he didn't know where he was—or if he was even alive. The cargo bay was tilted at a crazy angle, and Julian had to grab onto a broken panel to keep from sliding toward the wall.

"Julian!"

Mom's voice. He opened his eyes.

Smoke drifted everywhere, making everything hazy. Emergency lights glowed red, casting strange shadows. And there, climbing over a pile of broken crates, was his mom—carrying a still-crying Declan in one arm and reaching for him with the other.

"I'm okay," Julian said. His voice sounded weird, like he was talking through a pillow. "I'm okay, Mom."

"Oh, thank goodness." Mom pulled him into a hug, squeezing so tight he could barely breathe. "Thank goodness you're okay."

"Julian!" That was Ezra's voice. He was still strapped into his seat, the seatbelt keeping him from sliding down the tilted floor, looking scared but okay. "Julian, is everyone okay?! Is everyone alive?!"

"We're okay," Mom said, pulling Julian free. She was crying now, tears cutting tracks through the dust on her face. "We're all okay.Where's Ollie?"

They found the dog wedged under a supply cabinet, whimpering. He'd curled into the smallest ball he could make, his whole body shaking. As soon as Julian reached for him, Ollie licked his face and tried to wiggle free, tail wagging despite everything.

"Good boy," Julian whispered. "Good brave boy."

---

The next hour was chaos.

Some colonists were hurt—a broken arm here, a deep cut there, someone who couldn't wake up. The ship's doctor, Dr. Martinez, was running around doing what she could, her white coat now gray with dust and debris.

"We need to get out," Captain Reyes announced. She was standing on a crate to be seen, her uniform torn and her hair falling out of its braid. "The hull is compromised. We need to evacuate to higher ground before this thing comes apart."

"The beacon," someone called out. "What about the emergency beacon?"

"Communications are dead," the captain said. "Half our systems are gone. But we have one chance—the escape pods. We launch them, maybe someone sees the launch flare."

"One chance," Dad muttered. He was covered in dust and had a cut on his forehead, blood drying in a dark streak down his face, but he was thinking clearly. "And if nobody sees?"

"Then we walk." Captain Reyes looked around at all of them—fifty souls who had trusted her to get them to their new home. "We find the colony ourselves."

---

The escape pods launched six of the colonists who were hurt the worst—people who couldn't walk, who needed medical equipment. Julian watched them go, a tiny spark of hope as each pod streaked toward the sky.

Then the walking started.

The planet outside was nothing like Julian had expected. He'd grown up on spaceships, bouncing between stations and colony ships, never staying anywhere long enough to really know it. But this—this was like something from the old Earth storybooks.

Lush green forests covered the rolling hills as far as the eye could see. In the distance, towering mountains rose up like giants, their peaks still dusted with white even in summer. And everywhere, tall evergreen trees stretched toward the sky—forests like the Pacific Northwest, like Seattle, the place his parents talked about moving to someday.

"It's beautiful," Ezra breathed. For a moment, even the terror of the crash couldn't stop him from marveling at the world around them.

"Keep moving," Mom said gently, though her eyes were wet. "It's beautiful, but we need to find shelter before dark."

The colonists walked in a big group, fifty people picking their way through terrain that was harder than it looked. Some adults carried the injured on makeshift stretchers. Kids stayed in the middle, protected on all sides. Julian tried to help by carrying extra water, even though it was heavy and his arms ached.

Ollie stayed close to his side, ears perked up, nose twitching. The dog kept glancing back toward the forest, growling low in his throat.

"What is it, boy?" Julian whispered. "What do you smell?"

Ollie whined and pulled on his leash. He kept looking at something in the distance—a tall spire of crystal rising from the ground, catching the sunlight and throwing it everywhere like diamonds.

"What is that?" Ezra asked, pointing at the crystal spire. It was unlike anything Julian had ever seen, rising hundreds of feet into the air, its surface catching and reflecting light in ways that seemed almost magical.

"I don't know, honey," Mom said. "Maybe it's a natural formation. Some planets have amazing rock structures."

But Ollie didn't like it. The dog's ears were flat against his head now, his tail tucked between his legs. Whatever the crystal spire was, Ollie wanted nothing to do with it.

They made it halfway through the first day when the radio crackled to life.

"—Mayflower, this is Monscollis Colony, do you copy?"

Captain Reyes lunged for the radio, nearly falling in her haste. "This is Captain Reyes of the Mayflower! We have crashed! We have fifty survivors, including children! We're somewhere to the east of your location!"

"Copy that, Mayflower." The voice was tinny with static, but there was relief in it. "We've been trying to reach you for hours. We're sending a rescue team. Hold your position if you can. We'll find you."

"Hold our position," Captain Reyes said. "Good. Everyone, we need to—"

A scream cut her off.

Julian spun around. At the back of the group, people were pointing at the sky. Something was coming—fast. Not a ship, but something worse.

"Get down!" someone yelled.

The first rock hit twenty feet away, sending up a cloud of dirt and debris. Then another. Then a whole barrage of stones, bouncing and rolling down the hillside toward them like the world's worst avalanche.

"Run!" Dad shouted. "Everyone run! Get away from the slope!"

They ran. Julian grabbed Ezra's hand and pulled him along, his legs burning as he pushed harder than he'd ever pushed before. Mom had Declan in her arms, running even though she was already exhausted. Ollie barked and raced ahead, pulling at his leash until Julian let go.

"Jump!" Dad yelled, pointing to a gap in the rockslide. "Jump and don't stop!"

Julian leaped. For a heart-stopping moment, he was flying—and then he landed hard on the other side, rolling, gasping, Ezra landing beside him.

Behind them, rocks crashed into the path they'd been walking—exactly where they'd been standing seconds before. The noise was deafening, a thunder of stone against stone, and Julian felt the ground shake beneath him.

When the rockslide finally stopped, they were separated.

Julian, Ezra, and Ollie were on one side of the rubble. Mom, Dad, Declan, and the rest of the group were on the other. A gap twenty feet wide had opened up between them, filled with dust that was slowly starting to settle.

"JULIAN!" Mom screamed. Her voice was raw, desperate. "EZRA!"

"MOM!" Julian screamed back. "WE'RE OKAY!"

The gap was too wide to jump, too unstable to cross. And through the dust, he could see his parents—see them being pulled away by the others, heading in the wrong direction.

"Meet us at the crystal!" Dad shouted, his voice carrying across the divide. "The big spire! We'll find you there!"

And then they were gone, disappearing into the trees.

---

Julian and Ezra stood alone on the hillside, Ollie pressed against their legs. The dog whimpered, looking back and forth between the two boys, trying to understand what had happened.

For a long moment, neither boy spoke. The weight of everything—the crash, the walking, the rockslide, the separation—it was all too much.

Then Declan's face flashed in Julian's mind. His little brother, only two years old, scared and alone somewhere in the forest. And their parents, somewhere on the other side of that massive pile of rocks.

"Don't worry," Julian said, trying to be brave. His voice cracked, but he kept going. "We'll find them. We'll find mom and dad and Decker."

Ezra's lip trembled. "What if we can't?"

"We will." Julian took his brother's hand—Ezra's hand, he reminded himself, his brother Ezra, he needed to remember—and squeezed tight. "We're Nelson boys. We're tough. Come on. We have to keep moving."

They started walking toward the crystal spire in the distance, the giant structure growing larger with every step.

What they didn't know was that deep below that crystal—something ancient had just noticed them.

Something that had been waiting for a very, very long time.

Something that was very, very interested in two young boys who had just arrived on its planet.
