# Chapter 2: The Colony

The crystal spire was closer than it looked.

Julian had been walking for what felt like hours, his legs aching and his stomach growling. Ezra kept tugging at his sleeve, pointing at every weird bug or strange flower they passed. Ollie stayed close, his nose working overtime, sniffing every tree trunk and rock along the way.

"How much farther?" Ezra complained for the tenth time.

"I don't know," Julian admitted. "But Mom and Dad said to meet at the spire. That's where we'll find them."

The spire grew taller as they approached, rising from the forest like a giant's finger. Up close, it was even more amazing—the crystal surface caught the afternoon sunlight and threw it everywhere, painting the trees in rainbow colors. Tiny lights danced inside the crystal, like fireflies trapped in glass.

"It's pretty," Ezra said, his anger fading. "Really pretty."

But Ollie didn't think so. The dog pressed against Julian's leg, teeth bared, a low growl rumbling in his throat.

"Easy, boy," Julian whispered. "It's just a rock."

It wasn't just a rock. Julian knew it the moment they got closer. The crystal hummed with a sound he could feel in his bones—not loud, but deep, like the bass thump from Dad's old speakers. And the lights inside... they weren't random. They pulsed, almost like a heartbeat.

*THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.*

"Julian," Ezra said quietly. "Is it... breathing?"

Before Julian could answer, voices echoed through the trees.

"—sworn to check the eastern ridge. Captain said—"

"—can't believe they made it. Crash was three miles—"

People! Julian's heart leaped. He grabbed Ezra's hand and pulled him toward the voices, ignoring Ollie's protests.

"Help!" Julian shouted. "Over here! We need help!"

Branches cracked. Then a woman appeared—tall, with dark skin and short-cropped hair, wearing a uniform that looked like a spacesuit but softer. Behind her were three others, all carrying packs and looking shocked to see two kids.

"Holy stars," the woman breathed. "There are kids out here. How—who are you?"

"I'm Julian. This is my brother Ezra. Our parents—we got separated. There's a rockslide, and—"

"Easy, easy." The woman knelt down, her face softening. "I'm Captain Okonkwo—no relation to your family. And these are my scouts. You're safe now. We've got you."

The Monscollis Colony was nothing like Julian expected.

He'd imagined futuristic bubbles and flying cars—the kind of stuff from the old movies. Instead, it looked like a really fancy summer camp. Buildings made from wood and metal, with wide porches and solar panels on roofs. Gardens everywhere, full of vegetables and flowers. And people—hundreds of them—walking around looking busy but not scared.

"It's a town," Ezra said, his eyes big. "A real town."

"Three years old," Captain Okonkwo said, leading them through the main street. "We landed, built what we could. Not fancy, but it's home."

People stared at them. Julian didn't blame them—he was covered in dust and his clothes were torn. Ezra wasn't much better. Ollie walked between them, still nervous, ears flat against his head.

"How many people live here?" Julian asked.

"About two thousand now. We were smaller when we started. But more ships came—Colonists, supplies, hope." She smiled, but it was a tired smile. "We heard about the Mayflower. You've been traveling a long time."

"Since we were born," Ezra said. "Everything we've ever known is on a ship."

Captain Okonkwo's face did something complicated—sad, maybe, or understanding. "Then you'll fit right in. Most of us came from ships too."

They found Mom, Dad, and Declan in the colony's main hall—a big wooden building that served as hospital, meeting place, and cafeteria all in one.

"JULIAN! EZRA!"

Mom swept them into a hug so tight Julian thought he'd burst. Dad stood behind her, arms wrapped around all of them, his face wet with tears.

"We were so scared," Mom kept saying. "We thought we'd lost you. We thought—"

"We're okay," Julian said, hugging her back. "We're okay. Ollie kept us safe."

Declan, strapped to Dad's chest in a baby carrier, reached out and grabbed Julian's ear. "Juju," he said happily, like nothing had happened. Like they hadn't almost died.

"Hi, Decker." Julian ruffled his brother's hair. "You scared us, you know."

"Decker mad," Declan said, shaking his head. "No like rocks."

"No one liked the rocks," Ezra agreed.

That night, the colony gave them a place to stay—a small cabin with two rooms, plenty for a family of five plus one very tired dog. Julian lay on his cot, staring at the ceiling, listening to the sounds of the colony outside.

Ollie was curled up at his feet, finally relaxed for the first time since the crash. In the next room, he could hear Mom and Dad talking quietly, probably trying to figure out what to do next.

Tomorrow, Captain Reyes would meet with the colony leaders. There were decisions to make—where would the Mayflower survivors live? What would happen to the damaged ship? Would they ever be able to leave this planet?

But those were adult problems. Right now, Julian just needed to sleep.

*THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.*

Wait. What was that?

Julian sat up. The sound was coming from outside—far away, but unmistakable. That heartbeat rhythm, pulsing from the direction of the crystal spire.

*THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.*

It was faster now. Stronger.

"Julian?" Ezra's voice came from the other cot. "Do you hear that?"

"I hear it."

"It's the crystal," Ezra said. "Something's happening to it."

They weren't the only ones who heard it. Through the window, Julian could see lights flickering on throughout the colony. People were coming out of their cabins, looking toward the spire, murmuring among themselves.

And then—the spire exploded with light.

A beam of pure energy shot into the night sky, so bright Julian had to cover his eyes. The ground shook. Somewhere in the colony, a dog started howling. Ollie jumped to his feet, barking frantically.

The beam lasted only a few seconds. Then it was gone, the crystal going dark, the world going quiet again.

"What was that?!" Ezra whispered.

Julian didn't know. But in the morning, he was determined to find out.
