# Chapter 4: The Shadow Hand

Ezra's chest felt warm.

Not the bad kind of warm—not like when he ate too much candy and got a stomach ache. This was different. It felt like sunshine lived inside him now, a tiny star that pulsed with every breath he took.

"Ezra, are you okay?" Julian grabbed his shoulders, his eyes wide. "Say something!"

"I'm okay," Ezra said, and he meant it. He felt better than okay. He felt... alive. Like he'd been half-asleep his whole life and now he was finally awake. "Julian, something happened. Something really good."

"Something good?" Maya stared at the open Vault door, her voice climbing higher. "The door opened! The ancient door that nobody could open! And you just—you just touched it and—"

"How did you do that?" Tyler whispered. He looked like he might faint.

Ezra didn't know how to explain it. "It wanted me to," he said finally. "It was waiting for someone who... who felt things. Really felt things."

"That's you," Julian said quietly. He understood. Julian always understood, even when Ezra couldn't find the right words. "You feel everything."

Ollie pressed against Ezra's leg, whining softly. The dog's tail wagged slowly, like he was checking to make sure everything was okay. Ezra scratched behind Ollie's ears and felt a surge of... something. Love? Loyalty? Whatever it was, he could *feel* Ollie's feelings, like they were his own.

"We should get out of here," Julian said, looking around nervously. "Before the grown-ups come back."

"Too late for that," a voice echoed from above.

They all looked up. Dr. Fletcher stood at the edge of the Deep Dig, peering down at them with his sharp eyes. Behind him were three other scientists, all wearing gray uniforms and all looking very interested in what had just happened.

"Well, well," Dr. Fletcher said, his thin lips curving into a smile that didn't reach his eyes. "It seems our young visitor has a gift. Tell me, child—what did you see in there?"

Ezra's stomach twisted. Something was wrong. Dr. Fletcher's words were friendly, but his feelings weren't. Ezra could sense them now—greed, excitement, hunger. Like when Declan saw a cookie jar he wasn't supposed to touch.

"Nothing," Ezra lied. "Just an empty room."

Dr. Fletcher's smile grew colder. "An empty room? How disappointing. And yet... I could have sworn I saw a light. A very special light."

"We didn't see anything," Julian said quickly, stepping in front of Ezra. "We were just exploring. We're sorry. We'll leave now."

"Oh, I don't think so." Dr. Fletcher started climbing down the ladder into the dig. "You see, boys, this isn't just a door. This is the most important discovery in human history. And if you've activated something—anything—we need to study it. For science."

"We should go," Maya whispered, tugging on Julian's sleeve. "My parents told me Dr. Fletcher is... weird. They don't like him."

"Too late," Tyler squeaked.

Dr. Fletcher reached the bottom of the dig, his boots crunching on the stone. The other scientists followed, forming a half-circle around the kids. Ollie growled, his hackles rising.

"Now then," Dr. Fletcher said, his voice soft and dangerous. "Let's try this again. What did you find in the Vault?"

Ezra's chest grew warmer. The little star inside him pulsed faster, like it was worried too. He could feel it protecting him, wrapping around his heart like a shield.

"We found hope," Ezra said, surprising himself. The words came from somewhere deep inside—not from him exactly, but from the star. "We found something you lost a long time ago."

Dr. Fletcher's face went pale. "What did you say?"

"You lost it," Ezra continued, the words flowing like water. "You stopped believing in love. You stopped believing in help and kindness and giving to others. So the door wouldn't open for you. It could only open for someone who still believed."

For a moment, nobody spoke. The only sound was Ollie's low growl and the soft hum of the Vault's crystal walls.

Then Dr. Fletcher lunged forward, reaching for Ezra.

"NO!" Julian shouted, pushing Ezra behind him. "Don't touch him!"

But before Dr. Fletcher could grab either of them, something incredible happened.

Ezra's hand shot out—not because he decided to, but because the star inside him made him do it. The moment his fingers touched Dr. Fletcher's wrist, light exploded from his palm.

Warm, golden light.

Dr. Fletcher screamed and fell backward, clutching his arm. But when he looked down, his eyes went wide. The angry red scar he'd had for years—the one from a lab accident that never quite healed—was gone. Smooth skin, like it had never been hurt.

"You... you healed me," Dr. Fletcher whispered, staring at his arm in shock.

Ezra stared at his own hand, trembling. "I didn't mean to. I just—"

"RUN!" Maya shouted. "NOW!"

They ran.

Up the ladder, out of the Deep Dig, into the forest beyond. Julian pulled Ezra along, his hand tight around his brother's wrist. Maya and Tyler sprinted ahead, Ollie barking at their heels. Behind them, Dr. Fletcher's shouts echoed through the trees.

"Get them! Don't let them escape! The boy has the fragment!"

They didn't stop until they reached Maya's hideout—a small clearing deep in the woods, hidden by thick evergreen branches. All four kids collapsed on the moss, gasping for breath.

"What just happened?" Tyler wheezed. "What was that light?"

"That was the Covenant," Maya said, her eyes huge. "My dad told me stories about it. He said the ancient people used to have power like that—power to heal, power to create, power to do impossible things. But it was lost when they vanished."

"The star in the Vault," Ezra said quietly. "It went inside me. And now I can... I can feel things. And I can make light. And I healed Dr. Fletcher, even though I didn't want to."

Julian's face was pale. "Ezra, this is serious. If Dr. Fletcher knows you have that power, he's going to come after you. He's going to want to take it."

"He can't take it," Ezra said, touching his chest where the warmth lived. "It's part of me now. The voice said I needed it. Because shadows are coming."

"Shadows?" Maya looked around nervously. "What kind of shadows?"

Before anyone could answer, Ollie started barking—the urgent kind that meant danger was close. Through the trees, they could hear voices. Adult voices. Searching.

"They're looking for us," Julian said. "We need to get back to the colony. To Mom and Dad. They'll protect us."

"Will they?" Tyler asked. "Dr. Fletcher is important. The grown-ups listen to him."

"My parents will listen to me," Julian said firmly. "Come on. Stay close and stay quiet."

They crept through the forest, moving from tree to tree, trying to stay hidden. Ezra's chest pulsed with each step, the star inside him humming softly. He could feel the others—Julian's fear mixed with determination, Maya's excitement, Tyler's terror, Ollie's protective instincts.

And somewhere behind them, growing stronger, he could feel something else.

Darkness. Cold. Hungry.

The Shadow Hand was watching.

And they wanted what Ezra had more than anything in the universe.

That night, safe in their cabin with Mom and Dad standing guard, Julian lay awake thinking.

Dr. Fletcher had shown his true colors. The Shadow Hand was real. And his little brother—his five-year-old brother who loved drawing and got emotional about everything—now carried an ancient power inside him.

"Julian?" Ezra's voice came from the other cot. "Are you awake?"

"Yeah."

"I'm scared."

Julian wanted to say something brave, something that would make Ezra feel better. But he was scared too. So instead, he climbed out of bed and sat next to his brother, taking his hand.

"Me too," Julian admitted. "But we'll figure it out. Together."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Outside, somewhere in the darkness, the crystal spire pulsed once. Then twice.

The Covenant had chosen its first guardian.

Now it was waiting to see what would happen next.
