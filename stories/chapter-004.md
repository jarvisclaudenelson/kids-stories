# Chapter 4: Shadows Gathering

Ezra couldn't stop touching his own chest.

He pressed his palm flat against his sternum, right where the warmth lived. It was still there—that tiny, pulsing light—like someone had hidden a firefly inside him while he slept. Every heartbeat fed it. Every breath made it feel more real.

"Will you stop doing that?" Julian whispered, yanking Ezra's hand away. "You look like you're checking if you're alive."

"I kind of am," Ezra said.

They were back at the main hall for breakfast, sitting at a long table with the other Mayflower survivors. Declan was smashing blueberries with his spoon in a cheerful, focused way that meant he was about to make a serious mess. Ollie sat under the table, watching everyone's feet like a very hairy security guard.

"Ezwa has a star," Declan announced to no one in particular.

"Decker, *shh*," Julian hissed.

"Ezwa has a star in his *tummy*," Declan continued, louder.

Julian grabbed a piece of bread and handed it to Declan. "Here. Eat this."

"Staw," Declan said, but he took the bread.

Ezra wasn't really listening. He was watching Dr. Fletcher across the hall.

The scientist sat at a table with his gray-uniformed team, eating quietly and pretending to look at a tablet. But every few seconds, his eyes would flick up—toward Ezra, then away, then back again. Like a fish circling the same rock over and over.

Ezra had always been good at reading people. Empathy, Mom called it. A gift. And right now, everything about Dr. Fletcher looked wrong—the tight set of his jaw, the way he held his fork too carefully, the small, calculated glances. Warmth was what you felt from people who liked you. From Fletcher, Ezra felt something more like the draft under a cold door.

"He's watching us," Ezra said quietly.

Julian didn't even look. "I know."

"We should tell Mom and Dad."

"I know that too." Julian finally turned to look at Dr. Fletcher, and didn't look away. He stared right at the scientist with his most serious face—the one he used when he was losing a board game and refused to admit it. "Not yet, though. I don't want him to know we're scared."

"Juju," Ezra said. "I *am* scared."

"I know. Me too. Don't let him see it."

Maya found them after breakfast, tugging Ezra's sleeve and pulling them toward the trees.

"My dad recognized Dr. Fletcher last night," she said, once they were out of earshot, Tyler trotting to keep up. "He knew him from before. From Earth." She lowered her voice. "He said Fletcher got fired from the Global Science Institute five years ago. For stealing research that wasn't his."

Julian stopped walking. "He's a thief?"

"A *fired* thief," Tyler added helpfully.

"But the colony let him in," Ezra said, frowning. "How?"

Maya shrugged. "Dad says Fletcher's really good at seeming important. He wears the right clothes, uses the right words, has all the right pieces of paper." She looked at Ezra with wide, serious eyes. "He came to Monscollis because of the Vault. He knew about it before the rest of us did. He's been here two years. Waiting."

Ezra's star pulsed hard, once, like a warning.

"He's been here the whole time?" Julian said.

"The whole time," Maya confirmed. "And Dad says there are others. A whole group of people who knew. They call themselves—" She hesitated, glancing at her brother.

"The Shadow Hand," Tyler said, and his voice wobbled a little.

Silence.

Declan, who had been busy trying to get Ollie to carry a stick, looked up cheerfully. "Shadow haaand," he sang, like it was part of a song.

"Decker," Julian said, "that's not a good thing."

"Oh." Declan went back to the stick.

---

They heard the shout before they saw him.

"Boy! *Stop!*"

Dr. Fletcher was coming through the trees, moving faster than Ezra expected. Two of his gray-uniformed colleagues were with him, flanking wide. Ollie spun around and barked—the sharp, urgent kind, not the playful kind.

"Run," Julian said immediately.

They ran.

Ezra's legs pumped hard, the star inside him blazing warm with every step. He could hear Julian ahead, crashing through underbrush, and Maya shouting directions—*left! left here!*—and the heavy boots of the scientists somewhere behind.

Then Declan's foot caught a root.

He went down with a grunt, small arms pinwheeling. By the time Ezra turned around, Dr. Fletcher was there, looming over Declan with his tablet in one hand and a practiced, too-pleasant smile on his face.

"Easy now," Fletcher said, crouching down. "Nobody's in trouble. I just want to talk."

Declan looked up at him with big brown eyes. Then he said, very clearly: "You're *cold*."

Fletcher blinked. "What?"

"You feel cold." Declan pointed at his older brother, who had skidded to a stop a few feet away. "Ezwa said you feel like a cold door."

Fletcher stood and turned. There was Ezra—and behind Ezra, Julian, fists clenched, eyes blazing.

"The fragment," Fletcher said, his pleasant voice dropping away entirely. "I can measure it. I have equipment. I know it's inside you, boy. I just want to *study* it. To help people—"

"You want to *take* it," Ezra said.

Fletcher's face did something complicated. "I want to use it. For science. For progress. Things too important to leave in the hands of a *child*—"

He lunged forward and clamped his hand around Ezra's wrist.

What happened next, Ezra couldn't fully explain.

The warmth in his chest *rushed* outward—not into Fletcher, but through Ezra's own arm, like something was reshaping from the inside. His wrist stretched. That was the only word for it. His whole arm went long and elastic, like a rubber band being pulled too far, and Fletcher's grip closed on *nothing*. Ezra stumbled back, arm snapping to its normal length so fast it made a sound—*thwap*—like a bowstring.

Everyone froze.

Even Ollie stopped barking.

Ezra looked at his arm. It was fine. Normal. Five-year-old arm, brown eyes staring at it, completely bewildered.

"*What*," said Fletcher, staring at his empty hand.

"*WHAT*," said Julian, staring at his brother.

"Do it again," Declan said.

Ezra looked at Fletcher—at the scientist's face, which had gone from smug to stunned to hungry in about two seconds—and his star pulsed hard, like a fist squeezing around his heart.

He didn't think. He grabbed Declan under the arms, spun, and flung himself sideways through the narrowest gap in the trees—a gap that no regular kid his size could have fit through. But Ezra wasn't exactly regular-sized anymore. He pressed his shoulders together, sucked his whole body into something almost impossibly thin, and *slid* through the gap like water through a crack. Declan squeaked with surprise. Behind them, Fletcher's boots crashed to a halt.

"*How*—" Fletcher started.

"*NOW* we run," Maya said, already running.

This time, even Ollie didn't look back.

---

They didn't stop until they reached the cabin. Julian burst through the door so hard it swung into the wall.

Mom spun around from the kitchen counter. "What—"

"We need to tell you something," Julian said, breathing hard. "Everything. Right now."

Dad looked up from his work. He took one look at their faces—all of them, even Tyler and Maya—and quietly closed his laptop.

"Okay," he said. "Tell us."

So they did.

It took a while. Declan mostly narrated the parts he'd actually seen, which involved a lot of sound effects and dramatic arm-waving. But the hard part—the part that made Mom go very quiet—was when Ezra tried to show them.

He held out his arm over the kitchen table. Took a breath. Thought about the feeling from before—warm, stretchy, like taffy being pulled in the summer. And slowly, carefully, his fingers grew. Just an inch. Then two. Then three, reaching all the way across the table to tap lightly on the far edge, while the rest of his hand stayed where it was.

Mom made a sound that was almost a word.

Dad leaned forward slowly, like he was afraid any sudden movement would end what he was seeing.

Ezra pulled his fingers back, and they snapped into place. Normal hand. Normal arm. He pressed it to his chest and felt the star beat, warm and steady.

"The door opened for him," Julian said, sitting across from Dad. "Fletcher and his team tried for months. But Ezra just *touched* it."

"And Fletcher saw?" Dad said.

"He grabbed me," Ezra said. "And then—" He shrugged. "I stretched away."

Dad was quiet, thinking. He had the same look he got before a hard decision—not scared, just careful. "This Dr. Fletcher. Would he come here?"

"He'll be back," Maya said. She said it like a fact, not a guess. "My dad says the Shadow Hand doesn't stop."

Nobody argued.

Outside, the crystal spire pulsed in the fading evening light—one slow beat, then another. Like it was breathing. Like it was watching.

Like it was waiting to see what the children would do next.

Ezra pressed his hand to his chest and felt the star answer, warm and steady.

*We are still here,* it seemed to say. *So are you.*

That was enough. For now.
