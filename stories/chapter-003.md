# Chapter 3: The Vault

The beam was gone, but Julian couldn't stop thinking about it.

At breakfast, he poked at his food—some kind of grain mush with dried fruit—while Mom and Dad talked with the colony leaders about what came next. Ezra sat next to him, drawing pictures in the mush with his spoon.

"You've got that look," Ezra said, poking Julian's arm. "The 'I'm thinking too hard' look."

"The crystal did something," Julian said quietly. "Last night. It wasn't an accident."

"How do you know?"

"I just... know." Julian frowned. "Something important happened. I can feel it."

Ollie whined under the table, and Julian kicked him a piece of dried fruit. The dog's ears had been up all morning, alert and nervous.

Captain Okonkwo found them after breakfast.

"You two are up early," she said, crouching to their level. Her eyes were tired—she'd been up all night checking on things after the light beam. "Shouldn't you be sleeping in? You've had a rough couple of days."

"We can't sleep," Ezra said. "Too many things happened."

"Is that right?" Captain Okonkwo smiled, but it was a worried smile. "Well, I suppose I understand. Listen—I heard you two found the crystal spire before the others did. Saw some interesting things, did you?"

Julian nodded. "It was humming. And there were lights inside. Like... like they were alive."

The captain's expression shifted. "Interesting. Very interesting." She stood up, brushing dirt from her knees. "Come with me. There are some people I want you to meet."

---

The "people" were a group of scientists in the colony's only building made entirely of metal—the Technology Hub. They wore gray uniforms and looked at the boys like they were specimens under a microscope.

"Children," said the leader, a thin man with wild gray hair. "Yes, yes, very interesting. I'm Dr. Fletcher. I've been studying the spire since we arrived. Did you notice anything unusual? Anything at all?"

Julian hesitated. Something about Dr. Fletcher made him uncomfortable—the way his eyes glittered, the way he rubbed his hands together like he was waiting for something.

"The lights moved," Ezra said suddenly. "They went faster when I got closer. And the humming got louder."

Dr. Fletcher leaned forward. "Closer? You touched it?"

"No," Ezra said. "But I felt something. It was... it was like the crystal could tell I was there."

"Hmm." Dr. Fletcher made a note on his tablet. "Remarkable. Absolutely remarkable. Captain, we need to keep an eye on these children. They may be... useful."

"Useful for what?" Julian asked.

Dr. Fletcher's smile didn't reach his eyes. "For science, of course."

The next three days were boring. Mom and Dad worked with the other Mayflower survivors, helping to sort through what could be salvaged from the crash. Julian and Ezra were stuck in the cabin with Declan, who had way too much energy and no way to burn it off.

"We should explore," Julian said on the fourth morning. "There's got to be more cool stuff here."

"Like what?"

"I don't know. The crystal did something. Maybe there's other stuff."

Ollie's ears perked up at the word "explore." In no time, the three of them—plus the dog—were slipping out of the cabin and heading toward the forest.

They weren't alone for long.

"Hey! You guys!"

A girl about Julian's age came running up—she had red hair, freckles, and was wearing the same kind of simple clothes as the other colonists. Behind her, a younger boy trailed along, looking nervous.

"I'm Maya," the girl said, sticking out her hand. "This is my brother, Tyler. We've been watching you guys. You're the Mayflower kids, right?"

"I'm Julian. This is Ezra. And that's Declan. And Ollie."

"Ollie's a funny-looking dog," Tyler said.

"He's brave," Ezra said quickly. "And he's smart. He saved us in the crash."

Maya's eyes widened. "Really? Wow. Okay, you guys want to see something cool? We've got a secret."

"What kind of secret?" Julian asked.

Maya grinned. "The grown-ups call it the Deep Dig. It's a hole in the ground where the crystal thing goes underground. They've been digging for months. But last night, after the light beam, something changed." She lowered her voice. "I think they found something. But they're not telling anyone."

Julian and Ezra looked at each other.

"Show us," Julian said.

---

The Deep Dig was exactly what Maya said—a big hole in the ground, with metal supports holding up the walls and lights strung along the edges. But what was at the bottom was way more interesting than a hole.

It was a door.

A huge, ancient door, covered in symbols that didn't match anything Julian had ever seen. The metal was dark and smooth, like it had been polished by centuries of wind and time. And around the door frame, tiny lights pulsed—same lights as the crystal spire, but smaller, softer.

"Whoa," Ezra breathed.

"Dr. Fletcher's team found it two days ago," Maya whispered. "They've been trying to open it, but nothing works. They've used every tool, every machine. Nothing."

"How do they know it's a door?" Julian asked.

"Because there's a keyhole. See?" Maya pointed. "Except it's not a normal keyhole. It's shaped like... I don't know. A heart, maybe? Or a hand?"

Julian looked. She was right—the shape was weird, almost like a handprint mixed with a star.

"What does it do?" Tyler asked, his voice shaking. "What if it's dangerous?"

"It's not dangerous," Ezra said confidently. "It's waiting."

Everyone turned to look at him.

"How do you know?" Julian asked.

Ezra shrugged. "I just... feel it. It's like the crystal. It's not angry. It's sad, kind of. It's been waiting a really, really long time for someone to come find it."

"That's weird," Tyler said.

But Julian thought about what Dr. Fletcher had said. *They may be useful.* And the way the lights in the crystal had moved when Ezra got close.

"Ezra," Julian said slowly. "Try touching it."

"What? Me?"

"You're the one who feels it. You should try."

Ezra looked scared. But also curious. Slowly, he walked toward the door, his bare feet quiet on the cold stone floor. The lights pulsed faster as he got closer.

*THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.*

His heart was beating in time with them.

"Easy," Julian said, following close behind. "If it hurts or anything, pull back."

Ezra reached out his hand.

The moment his fingers touched the door, the world exploded with light.

---

It didn't hurt. It was warm—like sunshine on his skin, but everywhere, all at once. Ezra felt something rush through him, not scary but *big*, bigger than anything he'd ever felt before. He could feel the others in the room—Julian's worry, Maya's excitement, Tyler's fear, even Ollie's doggy concern. And beneath all of that, something else. Something ancient and kind and very, very sad.

*We've been waiting,* a voice said, but not with ears. With his heart. *So very long.*

"What are you?" Ezra whispered.

*We are what was left behind. When the light went out, we stayed. We hoped someone would come.*

"Why?"

*Because that's what love does. It waits. It hopes. It keeps going.*

The warmth built up in Ezra's hand, spreading up his arm, through his chest. He wasn't scared. He felt safe, like when Mom held him after a bad dream. Like when Dad made pancakes on Sunday morning.

"I want to help," Ezra said. "Can I help?"

*Yes,* the voice said. *Open your hand.*

Ezra did.

The door swung inward with a groan of ancient hinges. Beyond it was a small chamber, carved from living crystal. And in the center, floating in a beam of soft light, was something that looked like a star had been shrunk down and put in a glass box.

The star pulsed, and Ezra felt it—*felt* it—connect with something inside him. A tiny spark, like a seed being planted.

*Our first piece,* the voice said. *Take it, young one. You and your brothers will need it. The shadows are coming, and they want to snuff out our light forever.*

"I'll protect it," Ezra said, even though he didn't fully understand. "I promise."

The star drifted toward him, passing through the crystal box like it wasn't there. As it touched his chest, a new feeling bloomed inside—power, but not scary power. Good power. Power he could use to help people.

And then, as suddenly as it began, it was over.

Ezra stood in the chamber, the glowing star now a tiny point of light nestled in his heart. The door was open. Julian was running toward him. Maya and Tyler were staring with their mouths open.

And somewhere in the darkness beyond the chamber, someone was watching.

---

Dr. Fletcher stood in the shadows, his face twisted in a smile that had no warmth in it.

"Interesting," he murmured to himself. "Very interesting. A healer, huh? That's new." He pulled out a small device and spoke into it quietly. "The youngest one unlocked the Vault. Yes, I'm certain. Get word to the others. The Covenant fragment is active, and we've got three kids and a dog standing in our way."

He clicked off the device and slipped back into the darkness.

*Let the games begin.*
